# German Traffic Sign Classification Using CNN and Keras
### In this project, I used Python and TensorFlow to classify traffic signs.
### Dataset used: [German Traffic Sign Dataset](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). This dataset has more than 50,000 images of 43 classes.
### 96.06% testing accuracy.
