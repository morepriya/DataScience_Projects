## Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning
Project Summary Our aim is to predict the life expectancy of a person of a given country considering a number of factors like sex differences, mental illnesses, etc. The data set provides us with a number of factors which could be considered to make this prediction.

### Prerequisites
You must have Scikit Learn, Pandas (for Machine Leraning Model), Flask (for API) installed  and Heroku.

Functional Requirements The project is required to make the prediction of life expectancy. Moreover, it has perform data pre-processing and data analysis to make sure that accuracy could be achieved.

Technical Requirements The programming language used to make the project would be Python. The front end would be done on HTML.  Flask used to deploy the project. 

Project Deliverables The project will have a good user interface so that users can find it easy to interact to. Moreover, it will predict the life expectancy of the person who is living in a particular country. The user will have to enter a number of details so that the model can calculate according and predict the life expectancy of a person with those details.
