## Project Summary
Our aim is to predict the life expectancy of a person of a given country considering a number of factors like sex differences, mental illnesses, etc. The data set provides us with a number of factors which could be considered to make this prediction.

## Tools Frameworks
* pandas : used for data analysis.
* Numpy : perform a number of mathematical operations.
* scikit-learn : used to build machine learning models.
* Flask : extensible web microframework for building web applications with Python.
* HTML and CSS
* Heroku

## Functional Requirements
The project is required to make the prediction of life expectancy. Moreover, it has perform data pre-processing and data analysis to make sure that accuracy could be achieved.

## Project Deliverables
The project will have a good user interface so that users can find it easy to interact to. Moreover, it will predict the life expectancy of the person who is living in a particular country. The user will have to enter a number of details so that the model can calculate according and predict the life expectancy of a person with those details.
