## Project Summary
Our aim is to predict the life expectancy of a person of a given country considering a number of factors like Adult mortality,GDP,BMI,Alcohol,Scholling,etc. The data set provides us with a number of factors which could be considered to make this prediction.

## Tools Frameworks
* pandas : used for data analysis.
* Numpy : perform a number of mathematical operations.
* scikit-learn : used to build machine learning models.
* Flask : extensible web microframework for building web applications with Python.
* HTML and CSS
* Heroku

## Problem Description
A typical Regression Machine Learning project leverages historical data to predict insights into the future. This problem statement is aimed at predicting Life Expectancy rate of a country given various features. Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average time a human being is expected to live, Life expectancy depends on various factors: Regional variations, Economic Circumstances, Sex Differences, Mental Illnesses, Physical Illnesses, Education, Year of their birth and other demographic factors. This problem statement provides a way to predict average life expectancy of people living in a country when various factors such as year, GDP, Schooling, alcohol intake of people in the country, expenditure on healthcare system and some specific disease related deaths that happened in the country are given. 

I used linear regression and randomforest regression in which randomforest gave better accuracy of 96% so i used that model for deployment. 

Project is deployed on Heroku using heroku CLI
